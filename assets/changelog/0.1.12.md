Let’s take a look at what’s new in mpv-easy 0.1.12!

## performance

A lot of performance optimizations have been done and added cache support for the flex layout engine, now the rendering time per frame only takes 2-5ms(mpv-easy 0.1.11 takes about 10ms)

## translate
[mpv-translate](https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/tree/main/mpv-translate): a general mpv translation script, support multiple translation modes

Translation is the biggest feature update, and it can be used as a mpv js script, which means that as long as curl (for network requests) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (for extracting subtitles) are installed, you can use this script

Default subtitle is English

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/blob/main/assets/img/translate-en.png?raw=true" alt="English subtitle"/>
</div>

### default mode

Translate to Chinese

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/blob/main/assets/img/translate-en-cn.png?raw=true" alt="Chinese subtitle"/>
</div>


### mix-translate (ctrl+shif+t or ctrl+T)

Display Chinese and English

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/blob/main/assets/img/translate-en-cn-mix.png?raw=true" alt="mix-translate"/>
</div>

### interactive-translate (ctrl+i)

Click left mouse button to play the audio, and click the wheel to display the full sentence translation
<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/blob/main/assets/img/translate-en-interactive.png?raw=true" alt="interactive-translate"/>
</div>

### mix-translate and interactive-translate (ctrl+T then ctrl+i)

Mixed translation and interactive translation can be used at the same time

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img src="https://github.com/mpv-easy/mpv-easy/blob/main/assets/img/translate-en-interactive-mix.png?raw=true" alt="mix-translate and interactive-translate"/>
</div>

## mpv-copy-screen

This script is enabled by default on Windows, and you can copy the frame to the clipboard by pressing `ctrl+c`

## mpv-autoload

Added support for playing files without extensions, which is useful when playing some game videos. These videos only have hash names without suffixes. If you use mpv-easy to play them, it will automatically detect and load playable files of the same mode into the playlist

## uosc

The playlist supports dynamic paging. For performance reasons, only 8(config key: scrollList.maxItemCount) videos the current video will be loaded, so that lag can be avoided when playing a large number of videos(e.g. 2000 videos)


### filename

Click on the video/file name to open the file explorer or website

## polyfill

Added escape, unescape, encodeURIComponent, decodeURIComponent and other global functions

## tool

Added many useful functions

- md5: can be used to cache network requests based on URL
- fetch: now you don't need mpv-easy-ext, just install curl
- html: escapeHtml and unescapeHtml for handling escape characters in html
- getOptions: read the script-opts file, automatically convert the type, support number, string, boolean and color(Automatically convert ARGB to BGRA)
